## Loading data from a package

1. Suppose you have installed the `car` package
(Companion to Applied Regression, developed by 
John Fox at McMaster). Give the R commands 
to load the package, load the `Davis` dataset
from the package and print out the first six 
rows of the dataset.

## Adding transformed variables to a data frame

2. The `Davis` dataset includes
`weight` in kilograms and `height` in centimetres.
Body mass index (BMI) is defined to be weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of height in metres.
Create a variable BMI in your workspace from 
the Davis dataset, using `with()` to access variables
from `Davis`

3. Use the `transform()` command  to create `BMI`
and add it to the Davis data frame.

4. Load the `dplyr` package and use its
`mutate()` function twice, along with the 
`%>%` and `<-` operators, to add (i) `heightm`, height
in metres, and (ii) `BMI` to the `Davis` dataset.

5. BMI of 18.5 or less is considered underweight,
BMI in (18.5,25] is normal, BMI in (25,30] is overweight, and
BMI greater than 30 is obese.
Use the `cut()` function to create a categorical
variable `BMIcat` from the `BMI` variable 
and add it to the `Davis` dataset. The minimum 
`BMI` in the dataset is 15.8, and the maximum 
is 36.8.


6. The levels of the factor created by `cut()` will be 
the intervals (e.g., `(18.5,25]`)). Relabel these
as "underweight", "normal", "overweight", and "obese".
