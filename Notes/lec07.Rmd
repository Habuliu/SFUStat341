# Tidying (Reshaping) Data

## Tidying data with the tidyverse

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, etc
```


- Reading: Hadley Wickham's article on tidy data, available
from GitHub (Notes folder) or canvas.
    - Today's notes closely follow the `tidyr` vignette.

- "Tidy" data is ready for analysis, with one row for
each sampled unit and columns for the variables measured 
on the units.
    - Often classify variables as "explanatory" or "response"
    
- Tabular data and repeated measures data are often not 
in tidy form.

- Examples:
    - Tabular data on new tuberculosis cases from WHO
    - Repeated measures from Billboard Top 100
    
## Tuberculosis (TB) cases

\footnotesize
```{r}
tb <- read.csv("tb.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
dim(tb)
tb[1:4,1:6]
names(tb)[1:20]
```

## Structure of TB table

\small

- First column is 2-letter country code, second is year,
third is number of new cases for that country/year.
- Then come TB counts for different gender/age categories.
    - `new_sp` is "new cases by positive pulmonary smear assay"
    - gender is `m` or `f`
    - two special age categories 0-4, 5-14,
    - age categories 0-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 
    55-65, 65+, unknown (`u`)
- Gender/age columns are not variables, they are data
on the observed units.
- Tidy data would have one row for each country, year, gender
and age category, with a column of counts 

## Billboard Top 100 rankings of songs

\scriptsize
```{r}
bb <- read.csv("billboard.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(bb)
bb[1:3,1:6]
names(bb)[c(1:10,ncol(bb))]
```

## Structure of the Billboard table

- Columns `year` through `date.peaked` describe the song,
then `x1st.week` through `x76th.week` are the 
chart positions for the first through 76th weeks. 
    - If a song is on the chart for less than 76 weeks, its position is `NA` for any missing weeks.
- Weeks are not variables, they are the time data for the 
time series.

## Tidying the Billboard data

- Main step is to consolidate, or "gather" the
rankings in the different
weeks into a `rank` variable. 
- Before gathering, will select/rename some of the variables.
- After gathering, will create some new variables and 
sort the data frame.

## Select and rename

- Won't need `time` or `genre`. 
    - `select()` from `dplyr` can use `-` to de-select
- Rename `artist.inverted`
    - `rename()` from `dplyr` takes arguments of the form
    `newname = oldname`

\footnotesize

```{r}
bb <- 
  bb %>% select(-time,-genre) %>% 
  rename(artist = artist.inverted) 
```

## Gather the weeks into a "long" version of the Billboard data

\small

- Leave each song info variable as-is.
- The data, or "values", are the chart positions.
- The weeks are descriptors or "keys" for these values.
- We want to create key-value pairs for each observation.
    - There will be missing values, which we can remove.
- The `gather()` function from `tidyr` gathers specified
columns into keys (e.g., week) and values (e.g., rank).

## `gather()` for the Billboard data

\scriptsize
```{r}
# gather (data, key, value, ... ) where ... are the columns to collapse
bblong <- gather(bb,week,rank,x1st.week:x76th.week,na.rm=TRUE)
head(bblong,n=4)
```

## More cleaning suggested in the vignette

\small

- Extract week numbers from `week` variable
- Coerce `date.entered` to a `Date` object
- Calculate the date of each ranking based on 
the date it entered the charts and the week.
- Sort ("arrange") on artist, track and week.

\scriptsize
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bb <- 
  bblong %>% mutate(week = parse_number(week),
              date = as.Date(date.entered) + 7*(week-1)) %>%
  select(-date.entered) %>% # don't need date.entered anymore
  arrange(artist,track,week)
head(bb,n=3)
```

## Tidying the TB data

- Recall structure of the data: country, year, count of new cases, counts of new cases by 
gender/age categories.

\scriptsize

```{r}
names(tb)[1:10]
```

\normalsize

- Main step is to "gather" TB prevalence in the different
gender/age categories into a count variable.
    - Complicated by the coding of gender/age categories
- Before gathering, will remove unneeded variables and
add country names to supplement 2-letter codes.


## Remove variables

- Won't need overall count
- Special categories 0-4 and 5-14 overlap with 0-14 so remove
- Age unknown not useful for analysing trends, so remove 

\scriptsize
```{r}
tb <- select(tb,-new_sp, -contains("04"), -contains("514"),
             -new_sp_mu, -new_sp_fu)
tb[1:3,1:10]
```

## Add country names to supplement country codes

\footnotesize

- I found a translation of the ISO-2 country codes at
[http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list] and saved
as `countryCodes.csv` in the `Notes` folder. 
```{r}
cc <- read.csv("countryCodes.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# cc has columns "Name" and "Code". "Code" matches "iso2" in tb
```

##

- Exercise: Find out which ISO-2 codes are in `tb` but not in 
`countryCodes.csv`, google the missing codes, and 
add the country names to `cc` manually.

\scriptsize

```{r}
unique(tb$iso2[!(tb$iso2 %in% cc$Code)])
cc <- rbind(cc, data.frame(Name=c("Netherlands Antilles","Yugoslavia"),
                          Code=c("AN","YU")))
tb <- inner_join(cc,tb,by = c("Code" = "iso2")) 
tb[1:2,1:6]
```


## Gather counts for demographic groups

\footnotesize

- Create demographic variable `demog` and count variable `count` 
by gathering over all variables except `Name`, `Code` and `year`.

```{r}
tblong <- gather(tb,demog,count,-Name,-Code,-year,na.rm=TRUE)
head(tblong)
```

## Separate gender from age category.

\small

- First remove `new_sp_`, then separate result on first column (`help(separate)`)
```{r}
maxlen <- max(nchar(tblong$demog))
tblong %>% mutate(demog = substr(demog,8,maxlen)) %>%
  separate(demog, into=c("gender","agecat"),sep=1) -> tb
head(tb)
save(tb,file="tb.RData")
```


# Split-Apply-Combine

## Subgroup summaries

\small

- Data visualization and modelling is often
in terms of subgroups.
- Illustrate with some data on enrollments
in Stat and Act Sci courses over the 2007/08 to
2015/16 academic years.
    - Data on full-time equivalents
    (FTEs, equal to 30 credit hours taught)
    by year and course.
- Recurring theme: Need to split the data into subgroups, 
transform or summarize, and reassemble, or unsplit.
    - Has come to be known as "split-apply-combine"

## Science enrollments database

\small

- Load the `scilong` data frame created by
`FTE.Rmd` 
    - Look through the `FTE.Rmd` script if you 
    haven't already.
    
\scriptsize

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("scilong.RData")
head(scilong)
```

## Stat and Act Sci data 

\scriptsize

```{r}
stat <- filter(scilong,Subject=="STAT" | Subject=="ACMA")
head(stat)
```

## Split-apply-combine example 1: yearly percent FTEs

\small

- Suppose we want the percent of FTEs in a year
that are attributable to each course taught.
- Split the data by year, 
compute proportion of FTEs for each course in that year,
and combine the proportions into a variable that 
can be included in the `stat` data frame.
- Illustrate base R and `dplyr` approaches.

## Example 1: split

\small

- The base R function `split()` splits a data frame
on a grouping variable, which is a vector or 
list of vectors that can be coerced to factor(s),
and returns a list.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sp.stat <- split(stat,stat$year)
names(sp.stat)
head(sp.stat[["2008"]])
str(sp.stat[["2008"]])
```

## Example 1: Split, cont.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sp.stat <- split(stat,list(stat$year,stat$Subject))
names(sp.stat)
head(sp.stat[["2008.STAT"]])
```

## `group_by()` from `dplyr`

\small

- Call is similar to `split`, but we specify multiple
variables to group on by comma-separated
names.
- Output is a `tibble` (data frame with some different
default behaviours). 

\scriptsize

```{r}
sp.stat.dplyr <- group_by(stat,year,Subject)
sp.stat.dplyr
```


## Example 1: Apply 

\small

- Create a new variable
`FTEproportion = FTEs/sum(FTEs)` for each 
sub-group data frame and save the new variable
in the respective data frames.
- Can use the base R function `lappy()`
    - stands for "list apply" -- apply a function to 
    each element of a list and return a list as output
- It turns out the following call to `lapply()` does what
we want. 

\scriptsize

```{r}
tem <- lapply(sp.stat,transform,FTEproportion=FTEs/sum(FTEs))
```

\small

- To see why, start with simpler uses of `lapply()`.

## Simpler example of `lapply()`

\small

- Define a function to apply to each list element and
apply it:
```{r}
fsum <- function(x) { # x is a list element
  sum(x$FTEs) # assumes list elements have an FTEs column
}
tem <- lapply(sp.stat,fsum)
tem[1:2]
```

## Simpler example, cont.

\small

- If our function takes more arguments than just
the list element, we add them after the function name.

\scriptsize

```{r}
fsum <- function(x,cname) {
  sum(x[,cname]) 
}
tem <- lapply(sp.stat,fsum,"FTEs")
tem[1:2]
```

## Our use of `lapply()`

\small

- Adding a column to each sub-group data frame 
requires a function that takes the data frame
as an argument and returns the augmented version.
    - This is what `transform()` does

\scriptsize

```{r}
head(transform(sp.stat[[1]],FTEproportion = FTEs/sum(FTEs)))
```


## Putting it all together

\scriptsize

```{r}
sp.stat <- lapply(sp.stat,transform,FTEproportion=FTEs/sum(FTEs))
head(sp.stat[[1]])
```

## Detour: The apply family of functions in R

\small

- The "original" apply is `apply()`, which can 
be used to apply a function to rows or columns 
of a matrix.

\scriptsize

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:6,ncol=2,nrow=3)
mat
apply(mat,1,sum) # row-wise sums; rowSums() is faster
apply(mat,2,sum) # column-wise; colSums() is faster
```

## Detour, cont.

\small

- `sapply()` takes the output of `lapply()` and simplifies
to a vector or matrix.

\scriptsize

```{r}
fsum <- function(x) { sum(x$FTEs) }
sapply(sp.stat,fsum)[1:2]
````

## Detour, cont.

\small

- Other `apply`-like functions `vapply()`, `mapply()`,
`tapply()`, ...
- I don't use these.
    - See their respective help pages for information.
    


## The apply step with `dplyr`

\small

- Actions ("verbs") like `mutate()` are applied
to the data within groups when passed a 
grouped object.
    - That is, the data table is broken into groups and 
    `mutate()` is applied separately to each group.
    
\scriptsize

```{r}
sp.stat.dplyr <- mutate(sp.stat.dplyr,FTEpp = FTEs/sum(FTEs))
select(sp.stat.dplyr,Subject,FTEs,year,FTEpp)
```

## The combine step

\small

- The base R function `unsplit()` will combine
the elements of the list that was generated by `split()`
- Pass `unsplit()` the list of variables used
to define the splits.

\scriptsize

```{r}
head(unsplit(sp.stat,list(stat$year,stat$Subject)))
```

## The combine step with `dplyr`

\small

- Use `ungroup()`

\scriptsize

```{r}
ungroup(sp.stat.dplyr) 
```

## Summary of split-apply-combine

\scriptsize

- Base R:

```{r}
sp.stat <- split(stat,list(stat$year,stat$Subject))
sp.stat <- lapply(sp.stat,transform,FTEproportion = FTEs/sum(FTEs))
stat <- unsplit(sp.stat,list(stat$year,stat$Subject))
```

- `dplyr`

```{r}
stat %>% group_by(year,Subject) %>% 
  mutate(FTEproportion = FTEs/sum(FTEs)) %>%
  ungroup() -> stat
save(stat,file="statEnrol.RData")
```

## Split-apply-combine with `summarise()`

\small

- In the apply step, we may wish to calculate some
sort of summary, rather than a transformation
of a variable.
- For example, suppose we want to calculate 
total FTEs by year and subject, and return 
a data frame

\scriptsize

```{r}
stat %>% group_by(year,Subject) %>% 
  summarise(totalFTEs = sum(FTEs)) %>%
  ungroup() -> totals
head(totals,n=4)
```

## Split-apply-combine with `lapply()`

\small

- Compare to base R

\scriptsize

```{r}
tem <- split(stat,list(stat$year,stat$Subject))
tem <- lapply(tem,function(x) sum(x$FTEs))
tem[1:4]
```

- Then would have to write code to coerce 
output to a data frame.
